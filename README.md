# Meteorological Data Analysis System

**Developer:** Madison Crewse  
**Language:** Java  
**Date:** Spring 2025  

## 🌦️ Overview
A console-based Java application that simulates a meteorologist’s data analysis tool.
Users can input or load predefined weather records, then perform analytical operations such as calculating the heat index, identifying record highs, and generating statistical summaries for temperature and humidity data.

---

## 🧠 Features
-Load weather data via keyboard input or a sample dataset
-Compute Heat Index using the Rothfusz regression equation
-Identify record high temperatures and associated years
-Calculate average, minimum, maximum, and range for selected data fields
-Determine the largest day-to-day difference in temperature or humidity
-Navigate through a menu-driven interface for user-friendly interaction 

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
-Java SE
-Scanner (for user input)
-Arrays (for data storage and manipulation)
-Control Structures (if, while, for, switch)
-Modular Programming (reusable methods for clarity and organization)

---

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
-Modular and structured code design
-Statistical computation and data analysis
-Logical problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
-Clean coding and documentation practices
-Console-based user interface development

## 🧪 Example Output:
--- Meteorologist’s Data Analysis ---
Would you like to load data from the keyboard (1) or use predefined sample data (2)? : 2

--- Analysis Menu ---
(1) Display data and heat index for each day
(2) Display record high temperature for a given day
(3) Display average, max, min, and range for a field
(4) Display largest difference between consecutive values
(5) Stop analyzing

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java).  
2. Copy `MeteorologicalDataAnalysis.java` into your project folder.  
3. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac MeteorologicalDataAnalysis.java
   java MeteorologicalDataAnalysis
